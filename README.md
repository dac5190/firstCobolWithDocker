# firstCobolWithDocker
Just a simple repo for a really quick and dirty hello world Cobol example being compiled in Ubuntu through Docker.

Also, just as a warning, this script does clear out the older version of the docker instance.

Ensure docker cli is installed in the windows os you're running
Open up CMD (Windows key + r, then cmd and hit enter)
Navigate to the path you cloned this repo to
type in "runDockerFileNCompile.bat" and hit enter
You should now see the Cobol output (Hello World from Docker!)


If you have any other use for this, please feel free to grab and utilize (tis what the MIT license states I'm all for).
